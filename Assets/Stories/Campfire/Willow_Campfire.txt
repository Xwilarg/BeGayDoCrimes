The soup needs more paprika.
I wonder how dad is doing?
I swear if I see the headmaster from the temple again, I will punch them!
I should really tell her me true feelings...
I hate bandits so much! First they burn the temple and then me home! Those C*nts!
Yuki! Stop doing squats is time to eat!
Ya looked cool today Yuki!
Makra, that's enough herbs, you're gonna spoil the batch!
Damn! Makra the carrots are perfect! Nice job!
Stop being a baby Claire! You can wait a bit for seconds!
What are you lookin' at Claire? oh, I had some soup on the nose, thanks.

Can't believe those bandits were stupid enough to follow us, at least we f*ck them up!
We will need to rob that c*nt who told them to burn our home!

Guards now! Those wankers won't leave us alone!
