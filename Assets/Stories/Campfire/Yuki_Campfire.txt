28, 29, 30 squats! Let's go!
I wonder, if you two are watching me from up there?
That's enough training for today. Oh who am I kidding I can still go for more!
I should go see how ma's and pa's home is doing, I haven't gone there for a moment.
One day I'll give her that ring...
Willow tha broth is amazing! You need to show me how it's done!
Still up to train soon Willow?
Claire, could you help me with the fire?
We need to continue sparring soon Claire, I'm sure you'll get even stronger.
Makra you look sad, did you mess up your knitting?
Thanks again for repairing my clothes Makra! They feel even better now!

I not so sure that I should have let the bandits leave... but It might be for the better.
I wonder if ma and pa would be okay with us stealing someone like that... even if she attacked us.

Are we really doing the right thing? Stealing a train, even if we got robbed of our home...
