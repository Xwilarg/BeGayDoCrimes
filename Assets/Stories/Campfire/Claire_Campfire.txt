I should write to father more..
My feets hurts so much!
Is supper ready?
How long this we go to sleep?
I wonder... does she likes me?
Yuki is still training, how does she keep going?
My back is still so sore after training with Yuki.
Thank God Makra made me this wonderful sweeter, nights would be unbearable without it.
Makra do you want me to add more fire?
Willow... your food is so good, it reminds me of home.
Willow can you be a dear and pass me the salt?
